Suppose you're building a modular monolith, a type of software architecture where different components are organized into loosely coupled modules. Or you might need to process data asynchronously. You'll need a tool or service that allows you to implement this.

Messaging plays a crucial role in modern software architecture, enabling communication and coordination between loosely coupled components.

An in-memory message bus is particularly useful when high performance and low latency are critical requirements.

In today's issue, we will:

- Create the required messaging abstractions
- Build an in-memory message bus using channels
- Implement an integration event processor background job
- Demonstrate how to publish and consume messages asynchronously

Let's dive in.

## When To Use an In-Memory Message Bus

I have to preface this by saying that an in-memory message bus is far from a silver bullet. There are many caveats to using it, as you will soon learn.

But first, let's start with the pros of using an in-memory message bus:

- Because it works in memory, you have a very low-latency messaging system
- You can implement asynchronous (non-blocking) communication between components

However, there are a few drawbacks to this approach:

- Potential for losing messages if the application process goes down
- It only works inside of a single process, so it's not useful in distributed systems

A practical use case for an in-memory message bus is when building a modular monolith. You can implement [communication between modules](/explore/articles/milanjovanovic.tech/modular-monolith-communication-patterns.md) using integration events. When you need to extract some modules into a separate service, you can replace the in-memory bus with a distributed one.

## Defining The Messaging Abstractions

We will need a few abstractions to build our simple messaging system. From the client's perspective, we really only need two things. One abstraction is to publish messages, and another is to define a message handler.

The `IEventBus` interface exposes the `PublishAsync` method. This is what we will use to publish messages. There's also a generic constraint defined that only allows passing in an `IIntegrationEvent` instance.

```cs
public interface IEventBus
{
    Task PublishAsync<T>(
        T integrationEvent,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
        where T : class, IIntegrationEvent;
}
```

I want to be practical with the `IIntegrationEvent` abstraction, so I'll use [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`jbogard/MediatR`](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) for the pub-sub support. The `IIntegrationEvent` interface will inherit from `INotification`. This allows us to easily define `IIntegrationEvent` handlers using `INotificationHandler<T>`. Also, the `IIntegrationEvent` has an identifier, so we can track its execution.

The abstract `IntegrationEvent` serves as a base class for concrete implementations.

```cs
using MediatR;

public interface IIntegrationEvent : INotification
{
    Guid Id { get; init; }
}

public abstract record IntegrationEvent(Guid Id) : IIntegrationEvent;
```

## Simple In-Memory Queue Using Channels

The `System.Threading.Channels` namespace provides data structures for asynchronously passing messages between producers and consumers. Channels implement the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-wikipedia-w"/>producer/consumer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem). Producers asynchronously produce data, and consumers asynchronously consume that data. It's an essential pattern for building loosely coupled systems.

One of the primary motivations behind the adoption of [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-microsoft"/>.NET Channels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/channels) is their exceptional performance characteristics. Unlike traditional message queues, Channels operate entirely in memory. This has the disadvantage of the potential for message loss if the application crashes.

The `InMemoryMessageQueue` creates an unbounded channel using the `Channel.CreateUnbounded` bounded. This means the channel can have any number of readers and writers. It also exposes a `ChannelReader` and `ChannelWriter`, which allow consumers to publish and consume messages.

```cs
internal sealed class InMemoryMessageQueue
{
    private readonly Channel<IIntegrationEvent> _channel =
        Channel.CreateUnbounded<IIntegrationEvent>();

    public ChannelReader<IIntegrationEvent> Reader => _channel.Reader;

    public ChannelWriter<IIntegrationEvent> Writer => _channel.Writer;
}
```

You also need to register the `InMemoryMessageQueue` as a singleton with dependency injection:

```cs
builder.Services.AddSingleton<InMemoryMessageQueue>();
```

---

## Implementing The Event Bus

The `IEventBus` implementation is now straightforward with the use of channels. The `EventBus` class uses the `InMemoryMessageQueue` to access the `ChannelWriter` and write an event to the channel.

```cs
internal sealed class EventBus(InMemoryMessageQueue queue) : IEventBus
{
    public async Task PublishAsync<T>(
        T integrationEvent,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
        where T : class, IIntegrationEvent
    {
        await queue.Writer.WriteAsync(integrationEvent, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

We will register the `EventBus` as a singleton service with dependency injection because it's stateless:

```cs
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IEventBus, EventBus>();
```

---

## Consuming Integration Events

With the `EventBus` implementing the producer, we need a way to consume the published `IIntegrationEvent`. We can implement a simple [background service](/explore/articles/milanjovanovic.tech/running-background-tasks-in-asp-net-core.md) using the built-in `IHostedService` abstraction.

The `IntegrationEventProcessorJob` depends on the `InMemoryMessageQueue`, but this time for reading (consuming) messages. We'll use the `ChannelReader.ReadAllAsync` method to get back an `IAsyncEnumerable`. This allows us to consume all the messages in the `Channel` asynchronously.

The `IPublisher` from MediatR helps us connect the `IIntegrationEvent` with the respective handlers. It's important to resolve it from a custom scope if you want to inject scoped services into the event handlers.

```cs
internal sealed class IntegrationEventProcessorJob(
    InMemoryMessageQueue queue,
    IServiceScopeFactory serviceScopeFactory,
    ILogger<IntegrationEventProcessorJob> logger)
    : BackgroundService
{
    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        await foreach (IIntegrationEvent integrationEvent in
            queue.Reader.ReadAllAsync(stoppingToken))
        {
            try
            {
                using IServiceScope scope = serviceScopeFactory.CreateScope();

                IPublisher publisher = scope.ServiceProvider
                    .GetRequiredService<IPublisher>();

                await publisher.Publish(integrationEvent, stoppingToken);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                logger.LogError(
                    ex,
                    "Something went wrong! {IntegrationEventId}",
                    integrationEvent.Id);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Don't forget to register the hosted service:

```cs
builder.Services.AddHostedService<IntegrationEventProcessorJob>();
```

---

## Using The In-Memory Message Bus

With all of the necessary abstractions in place, we can finally use the in-memory message bus.

The `IEventBus` service will write the message to the `Channel` and immediately return. This allows you to publish messages in a non-blocking way, which can improve performance.

```cs{3,16-19}
internal sealed class RegisterUserCommandHandler(
    IUserRepository userRepository,
    IEventBus eventBus)
    : ICommandHandler<RegisterUserCommand>
{
    public async Task<User> Handle(
        RegisterUserCommand command,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // First, register the user.
        User user = CreateFromCommand(command);

        userRepository.Insert(user);

        // Now we can publish the event.
        await eventBus.PublishAsync(
            new UserRegisteredIntegrationEvent(user.Id),
            cancellationToken);

        return user;
    }
}
```

This solves the producer side, but we also need to create a consumer for the `UserRegisteredIntegrationEvent` message. This part is greatly simplified because I'm using MediatR in this implementation.

We need to define an `INotificationHandler` implementation handling the integration event `UserRegisteredIntegrationEvent`. This will be the `UserRegisteredIntegrationEventHandler`.

When the background job reads the `UserRegisteredIntegrationEvent` from the `Channel`, it will publish the message and execute the handler.

```cs
internal sealed class UserRegisteredIntegrationEventHandler
    : INotificationHandler<UserRegisteredIntegrationEvent>
{
    public async Task Handle(
        UserRegisteredIntegrationEvent event,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Asynchronously handle the event.
    }
}
```

## Improvement Points

While our basic in-memory message bus is functional, there are several areas we can improve:

- **Resilience** - We can introduce retries when we run into exceptions, which will improve the reliability of the message bus.
- **Idempotency** - Ask yourself if you want to handle the same message twice. The [idempotent consumer pattern](/explore/articles/milanjovanovic.tech/idempotent-consumer-handling-duplicate-messages.md) elegantly solves this problem.
- **Dead Letter Queue** - Sometimes, we won't be able to handle a message correctly. It's a good idea to introduce a persistent storage for these messages. This is called a [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-aws"/>Dead Letter Queue](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/dead-letter-queue/), and it allows for troubleshooting at a later time.

We've covered the key aspects of building an in-memory message bus using .NET Channels. You can extend this further by implementing the improvements for a more robust solution.

Remember that this implementation only works inside of one process. Consider using a real message broker if you need a more reliable solution.

That's all for today. I'll see you next week.
