> Available from Swift 4.2

[SE-0207 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0207-containsOnly.md) provides a new `allSatisfy()` method that checks whether all items in a sequence pass a condition.

For example, if we had an array of exam results like this:

```swift
let scores = [85, 88, 95, 92]
```

We could decide whether a student passed their course by checking whether all their exam results were 85 or higher:

```swift
let passed = scores.allSatisfy { $0 >= 85 }
```
