> Available from Swift 1.2

Swift 1.2 introduced a new `Set` type that works similarly to `NSSet` except with value semantics. Sets work similarly to arrays except they are not ordered and do not store any element more than once. For example:

```swift
var starships = Set<String>()
starships.insert("Serenity")
starships.insert("Enterprise")
starships.insert("Executor")
starships.insert("Serenity")
starships.insert("Serenity")
```

Even though that code tries to insert Serenity three times, it will only be stored in the set once.
