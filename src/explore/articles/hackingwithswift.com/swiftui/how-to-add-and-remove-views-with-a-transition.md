You can include or exclude a view in your design just by using a regular Swift condition. For example, this adds or removes some details text when a button is tapped:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showDetails = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Press to show details") {
                withAnimation {
                    showDetails.toggle()
                }
            }

            if showDetails {
                Text("Details go here.")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

By default, SwiftUI uses a fade animation to insert or remove views, but you can change that if you want by attaching a `transition()` modifier to a view.

For example, we could make several text views transition in different ways, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showDetails = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Press to show details") {
                withAnimation {
                    showDetails.toggle()
                }
            }

            if showDetails {
                // Moves in from the bottom
                Text("Details go here.")
                    .transition(.move(edge: .bottom))

                // Moves in from leading out, out to trailing edge.
                Text("Details go here.")
                    .transition(.slide)

                // Starts small and grows to full size.
                Text("Details go here.")
                    .transition(.scale)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
