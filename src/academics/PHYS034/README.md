## COURSE OUTLINE

We will cover the following topics: special relativity and relativistic mechanics, the quantum nature of energy and matter, the Schrödinger equation, atomic structure, nuclear structure and decays, the physics of solids, the physics of semiconductors, and elementary particle physics.

## LEARNING OUTCOMES

After completing this course, Students will be able to

- Outline the development of modern physics in terms of the problems being confronted and their relationship to our understanding of the natural world.
- Apply physical laws at the limits of high velocities (special relativity) and small distances and energies (quantum physics).
- Students will appreciate the probabilistic nature of physics in the quantum regime.
- Students will be able to apply the equivalence of energy and mass to a range of physical phenomena.
- Students will be familiar with the basics tenets of special relativity, relativistic mechanics, the quantum nature of energy and matter, the Schrodinger equation, atomic structure, nuclear structure and decays, the physics of solids, the physics of semiconductors, and elementary particle physics.
