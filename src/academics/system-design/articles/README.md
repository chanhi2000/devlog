I'm aware that Clean Architecture isn't a silver bullet, so I will discuss what types of systems can benefit from this architecture. Clean architecture isn't revolutionary. But it's prescriptive about how you should structure the code. It's an evolution of the layered architecture, focusing on the core domain and the direction of dependencies.
