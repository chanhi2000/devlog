  "desc": "Designing long-lived processes in a distributed environment is an interesting engineering challenge. And a well known pattern for solving this problem is a Saga.

Sagas come in two forms: Orchestrated Choreographed With an orchestrated Saga, there's a central component responsible for orchestrating the individual steps. In a choreographed Saga, processes work independently but coordinate with each other using events.",
